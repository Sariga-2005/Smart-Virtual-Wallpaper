# Smart-Virtual-Wallpaper
A web-based application that allows users to realistically preview wallpaper designs on real room photos. Users can manually select wall regions, apply seamless wallpaper patterns, adjust visual parameters, and download a high-resolution final render all directly in the browser using HTML5 Canvas.

This project focuses on realistic rendering, precise masking, and user-controlled visual customization.
